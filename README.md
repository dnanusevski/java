public static vodi main (String arg[])

PUBLIC - access modifier
STATIC - allow class method invocation before class object is instantiated
VOID - no return value

String args - parameters of the method (vars that are passed to paramteres are arguments)

In java variables can bi declared like following
int a,b,cl

int
float (single precisioan)
double (double precision) most used

When int is used in artimetic operations the point after dot is lost (fractional component): 10 / 4 = 2
WHen float is used instead we get 2.5

code block - blocks of code are inside {} brackets
statement  - one line with semicolon at the "end"
identifier -  is, essentially, a name given to a method, a variable, or any other userdefined item
variable - is named memory location


JAVA simple / primitive data types

	boolean - 	true false
	
	
	(float point) float		-	32 bit Single precision floating point
	(float point) double	-	64 bit Double precision floating point (most used)
	
	
	(integer) char  	- 	character (but also belongs in (integer) family 16 bit unsigned)
	
	(integer) byte	- 	8bit integer	- 8
	(integer) short	-	Short integer	- 16bit
	(integer) int 	-	Integer			- 32bit	(2147 Milions +- from negatie to positive)
	(integer) long 	-	Ilong integer	- 64bit
	
	
	
CHAR

	it is initialized by ''
	it can be incremented
	
BOOLEAN

	if outputed in println will convert to true or false string
	+ is more important then < > so use it like println( "so the result of 10 < 2 is " + (10 < 2))
    
LITERALS
    Now that we have explained above we can say that java literals are values that are human readable and 
    are assigned to java primitives. 
    For example: 
        45      -   (integer literal), 
        77.554  -   (double literal) 
        'a'     -   character literal 
        10.6F   -   float literal
        10.6L  -   Long literal
    One of the literals is string literal, a combination of characters
